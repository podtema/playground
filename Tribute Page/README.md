## Free Coding Camp

In order to refresh some of my skills, I've enrolled in Free Coding Camp (among other places I'm currently using for studying, such as [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com]), [Code School](http://codeschool.com), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) and more.) I'm doing challenges whenever I've got a minute, trying to utilize everything I learn.

This page is part of Free Coding Camp project, a [Tribute page](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page). Should be similar and look alike this [page](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW/).

I've chose to use flexbox for this project alongside Bootstrap.
